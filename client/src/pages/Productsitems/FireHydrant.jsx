            A fire hydrant system is a crucial component of any buildingâ€™s fire
            safety infrastructure. It comprises a network of pipes and valves
            that are connected to a pressurized water source, such as a water
            tank or municipal water supply. In the event of a fire, the hydrant
            system allows firefighters to quickly and easily access a large
            volume of water, helping to extinguish flames and prevent the spread
            of fire.
